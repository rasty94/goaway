### Contributing

Contributions are welcomed! Here's how you can help:

1. **Report Issues:** Found a bug? [Create an issue](https://github.com/pommee/goaway/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)
2. **Request Features:** Have an idea? [Start a discussion](https://github.com/pommee/goaway/discussions) or create a [feature request](https://github.com/pommee/goaway/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)
3. **Submit PRs:** Before any work is started, create a new issue explaining what is wanted, why it would fit, how it can be done, so on and so forth...  
   Once the topic has been discussed with a maintainer then either you or a maintainer starts with the implementation. This is done to prevent any collisions, save time and confusion. [Read more here](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Denied (Port 53)**

- DNS servers typically require elevated privileges to bind to port 53.
  - **Linux**: You can run `sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep /path/to/goaway` to grant the binary permission to bind to privileged ports without needing full root access.
  - Alternatively, run the program as `root` (e.g. `sudo goaway`) or change the DNS port in your configuration to a non-privileged one (e.g. `5353`).

**Can't Access Dashboard**

- Check if port 8080 is available and not blocked by firewall
- Try accessing via `http://localhost:8080` on the same machine

**DNS Not Working**

- Verify GoAway is running and listening on the correct interface
- Check device DNS settings point to GoAway's IP address
- Test with `nslookup google.com <goaway-ip>` or `dig @<goaway-ip> google.com.`

## Performance

GoAway is designed to be lightweight and efficient:

- **Memory Usage:** Typically < 50MB RAM, depends on usage
- **CPU Usage:** Minimal impact on system performance
- **Network:** Low latency DNS resolution
- **Storage:** Logs and statistics use minimal disk space
